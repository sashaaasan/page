            WELCOME TO HANANACRAFT!
            <br>
            JAVA EDITION CIT ADD-ON
        </p>
        <p>Hananacraft is a Minecraft CIT resource pack that adds items to make your world more aesthetically pleasing.
        Please note that this pack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i class="fa-solid яfa-minus"></i>
                is originally in Java edition, but now has a separate Bedrock port
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-minus"></i> 
                works for minecraft 1.13 and up
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-minus"></i>
                requires optifine and invisible item frames to display correctly
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-minus"></i>
                is meant to be used alongside Mizuno's 16 craft and Ghoulcraft, though it should still work even if you
                don't!
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p >I'm (not exactly) back! But good news! I recently got a new laptop with a much better graphics card than my previous one, so I'm planning on doing video tours of my builds~</p>
                <br>
            <p>Oh also also, I'm heading off to uni soon (cries) but before that, I promise to drop <span>one last CIT pack</span>, and maybe a video showing my CIT-making process! So lemme know if ya'll would be interested in that! I won't spoil too much of the new CIT pack, but it's a thank you to all the support and love I've received for my work </p>
                <br>
             <p class="coc">p.s. tbh idk if there even is a need for more CIT packs? I feel like people may be getting overwhelmed by all the options hahah, but yeahhh Im super interested in hearing thoughts on that!</p>
